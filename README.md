# Eric Mikkelsen Asana Take Home Test
This is my Take home test for the Web Developer position.

It's a React app with a node server that:

- lists the project name and all tasks associated with the project 
- links to the associated task in app.asana.com
- includes a button that hides that individual task from view

## Installation
1. `npm install` or `yarn start`
2. copy the .env-xample file and rename it .env
3. add the credentials from a web app entry

## Running
1. `npm run start` or `yarn start`
2. If everything worked out ok you should have a browser window pop up

## Using
1. Get a project id
2. Enter it into the input labeled "Enter project id"
3. If you want to hide a task just click the button on the task that says "Hide Task"
4. To see all your hidden tasks click the purple button that says "Show Hidden Tasks"
